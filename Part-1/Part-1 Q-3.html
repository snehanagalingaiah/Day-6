 <p>Javascript automatically inserts semi colons at the end of the statements if its missing. This process is known as 
    Automatic Semicolon Insertion(ASI). Lets break down the provided code.</p>
  <p> 1. alert("I'm JavaScript!"); This line is correct and will display a message box with the content "I'm JavaScript!".</p>
  <p> 2. alert('Hello'): This line is also correct. Although it doesn't have a semicolon at the end, ASI will automatically insert it, and the code will work fine. </p>
  <p> 3. alert(`Wor ld`): The code inside the backticks is allowed to span multiple lines, so this is valid code. It will display a message box with "Wor ld". </p>
  <p> 4. alert(3 + 1 + 2);: This line also works fine. The addition is split across multiple lines, but JavaScript allows this, and ASI will automatically insert the necessary semicolons.</p>
